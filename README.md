 An Android app which shows Crypto Currency Exchange Rates. 
.  In this application I am using MVVM architecture to display crypto currency exchange rates.
.  I am using retrofit library to fetch the data from two different api.
.  I am using glide library to load the image based on the url fetched from api.
.  I am using shimmer library for showing loading state while we are fetching data for better user interactions.
.  I have implemented pull/swipe to refresh mechanism.
.  I have also implemented auto-refresh mechanism at 3 mintues.
.  I have implemented error dialouge incase we fail to load the data.
.  I am also showing dedicated textview to display when the data was last fetched.
